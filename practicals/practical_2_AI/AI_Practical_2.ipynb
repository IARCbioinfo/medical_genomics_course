    "__Lung cancer and its major subtypes__\n",
    "\n",
    "Lung cancer remains the leading cause of cancer-related death worldwide, responsible for approximately 1.8 million deaths each year (GLOBOCAN 2022). It encompasses several biologically distinct diseases, broadly divided into:\n",
    "\n",
    "- Small-cell lung carcinoma (SCLC) — about 15% of cases, usually very aggressive and strongly associated with smoking.\n",
    "- Non-small-cell lung carcinoma (NSCLC) — around 85% of cases, including:\n",
    "    - Lung adenocarcinoma (LUAD)\n",
    "    - Lung squamous cell carcinoma (LUSC)\n",
    "      \n",
    "Among them, LUAD is the most common subtype (≈40–50% of all lung cancers). It typically develops in the peripheral regions of the lungs and, although often associated with smoking, it also occurs in non-smokers, especially in women and in Asian populations. In contrast, LUSC usually arises in the central bronchi and shows a stronger correlation with heavy tobacco exposure.\n",
    "\n",
    "Distinguishing LUAD from LUSC is a routine diagnostic task for pathologists using hematoxylin–eosin (H&E) stained slides. Their characteristic morphology (glandular structures in LUAD vs keratin pearls and intercellular bridges in LUSC) makes visual diagnosis relatively straightforward. Consequently, LUAD–LUSC classification is often used as a benchmark for computational pathology models, though it is an “easy task” for trained pathologists.\n",
    "\n",
    "Now that we have seen how to compute slide embeddings, in this practical, we will go beyond this basic classification and explore more clinically meaningful applications of artificial intelligence in pathology using the slide embeddings obtained from [CPTAC-LUAD](https://www.cancerimagingarchive.net/collection/cptac-luad/) using two SOTA models: Titan and Feather."

    "## The importance of EGFR in lung adenocarcinoma\n",
    "The EGFR gene (Epidermal Growth Factor Receptor) encodes a transmembrane receptor tyrosine kinase involved in cell proliferation, survival, and differentiation. Activating mutations in EGFR lead to continuous signaling through pathways such as MAPK and PI3K–AKT, promoting uncontrolled tumour growth. EGFR mutations occur in roughly 10–15% of LUAD cases in Western populations, and up to 40–50% in East Asian patients, and are more common in never-smokers (and in women and East-Asian populations) than in smokers (Ko 2022). There is also growing evidence that ambient air pollution (PM2.5) can promote EGFR-mutant LUAD in people who have never smoked (Hill et al., Nature 2023).\n",
    "\n",
    "The discovery of EGFR mutations in the early 2000s revolutionized lung cancer therapy by introducing targeted treatments known as EGFR tyrosine kinase inhibitors (TKIs) (Lynch et al., NEJM 2004; Paez et al., Science 2004). These drugs — such as gefitinib, erlotinib, or osimertinib — block aberrant EGFR signaling and can lead to dramatic tumour shrinkage and prolonged survival compared with standard chemotherapy. First-line osimertinib (a 3rd-generation EGFR-TKI) has dramatically improved survival outcomes in EGFR-mutant lung adenocarcinoma. The FLAURA2 trial combining osimertinib + platinum-based chemotherapy reported a median OS of 47.5 months—nearly double the survival observed before the TKI era, when platinum chemotherapy alone yielded a median OS of 23.6 months (Maemondo et al., NEJM 2010; FLAURA2 WCLC 2025 abstract; AstraZeneca Press Release, 2025).\n",
    "\n",
    "In clinical practice, EGFR status is typically determined through molecular testing (DNA sequencing, PCR, or next-generation sequencing). However, these tests require specialized equipment, time, and cost, and may not be available in all hospitals — particularly in low-resource settings.\n",
    "\n",
    "Routine histology is available for every case. If AI could screen for EGFR mutation status directly from H&E:\n",
    "- results could be fast and low-cost,\n",
    "- triage could prioritize confirmatory molecular testing,\n",
    "- and settings with limited molecular infrastructure could benefit sooner."
